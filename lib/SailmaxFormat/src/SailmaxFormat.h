      * Project:  Sailmax-CU, Sailmax Format Conversions
      * Purpose:  reading and writing propriatary Sailmax format
      * Author:   Â© Ronnie Zeiller, 2018
      * Some code taken from the Seasmart conversion by Thomas Sarlandie
      * Format is similar to Seasmart, but easier readable by humans to analyze
      * wath is really going on the N2k bus.
